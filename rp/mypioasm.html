    <h2>RP2040 PIO runtime assembler</h2>
    <br>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <h3>What is it good for?</h3>
    <p>The goal of this development is to be able to create C++ objects
      which generate the binary to put into the PIO state machine
      configuration and instruction memories.<br>
      This is to not have to use a make program to run the vendor's pio
      assembler tools to create C++ source files.<br>
      It is also an avenue to dynamically modifying pio programs as the
      application discovers useful things.<br>
      While this could be done via parsing a text string, that parsing
      can be done at compile time reducing the amount of bytes being
      embedded in the program text segment. </p>
    <p>Construction of a program object will record options needed for
      configuration, such as sideset number of bits. <br>
      The program object will have an array of instruction objects which
      are at runtime used to create the instruction memory contents.<br>
      There is a chance that templates will be able to do the
      'compilation', we shall see. The difficulty there is forward
      referenced jump targets.</p>
    <p>One approach would be to have an indefinite sized array of
      assembler directive objects. Iteration over them would generate
      the assembled binary.<br>
      Such objects would sometimes just update the configuration image.</p>
    <p>A big caveat is that you cannot reliably use structs with bit
      fields for the actual configuration registers as the C++ compiler
      cannot be told that all must be accessed as 32 bit objects. This
      is a common problem with cortex parts, peripheral registers that
      must be accessed as specific widths that might be wider than the
      compiler thinks it can get by with.</p>
    <p>The non optimized approach is to use such structs but in regular
      memory, then copy as a block into the peripherals. In the case of
      an application downloading different programs at different times
      that is actually an optimal approach.<br>
      A PIO program image must be relocatable, PIO's share memory and as
      such unrelated programs must be stuffed into that memory. Such
      relocation is not particularly difficult, each address in the
      program image is relative to the image's first instruction and the
      loader can add the load address to each instruction that needs it
      as it writes them to the PIO memory.</p>
    <hr>The hardest task is forward branch references. A preliminary
    version of this assembler that only allows manually computed
    relative jumps allows the tech to be investigate to see if it really
    does reduce the number of bytes of program.<br>
    The ultimate goal is a template/constexpr based version to minimize
    program footprint. That is not difficult except for branches.
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Basics<br>
    </h4>
    Any PIO program must get written into the PIO's shared program
    memory and that is when we resolve jump addresses.<br>
    While meaningful text for program labels is desirable, experience
    with the asm facility built into gcc shows that given the maximum
    size of such programs using numerical labels is workable. This
    allows us to fit the label into the jump address field of the
    instruction words, to be resolved by the loader.<br>
    Branch instructions are given a numerical value for the target
    address. <br>
    Label objects in the program text do not result in code being
    generated. <br>
    <br>
    The load process starts with scanning the PIO program for label
    directives. A table is built (or just filled if statically
    allocated) to hold label:load address values. <br>
    As the program lines are written to the PIO memory the address field
    of the branch is replaced by a value from the table. <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    PIO programs also have program context, that must be written to PIO
    control registers before the program executes. Some of those values
    are pertinent to the binary patterns in the instructions, as
    constraints. The program load and register setting can happen in any
    order so long as both are done before the PIO state machine is
    started.<br>

    <h3>Linking Loader</h3>
    A run time linking loader is simpler than manipulating linker
    segments, and is almost free since we need to actively load the
    program regardless of how the image is formed.<br>
    <br>
    A program line object can hold attributes as well as the content.<br>
    Each program line is a constructor call, saving off fields that will
    generate the bit pattern later.<br>
    One of the fields can be a const char&nbsp; * which has the size of
    a pointer locally and of the string in the ro section.<br>
    The loader will scan the program and for each JMP can do a linear
    scan of the whole program which is at most 32 items.<br>
    If we can force the linker to share string constants that would be
    nice, if not we do strcmp.<br>
    Other attributes will be booleans like "load loop register with this
    item's address". <br>
    While this doesn't allow a compile time determination of double use,
    neither does anyone else's tool as far as I know.<br>
    <br>
    PioLines can be either instructions or labels, a union of const char
    * and PioInstruction, and PioControl.<br>
    PioInstruction factories will be constexpr and will call constexpr
    constructors of each instruction format.<br>
    PioControls are things like execctrl options such as output field
    origin, input field origin, testbit, sideset/delay selector.<br>
    If those PioControls are not all set by a single constexpr call we
    can't use them to create compilations errors when generating
    PioInstructions.<br>
    <br>
    If we don't recognize a faulty program until we go to load it then
    the application must have some mechanism for reporting that to
    users, and that mechanism should be const constructor callable. <br>
    wtf() needs to add a maxTracker that can be interrogated and
    cleared, and perhaps a "last 8 errors mru with counts" optional
    feature.<br>
    So we will need a constable ProgramContext that can be constexpr
    constructed and referenced by PioLine generators. A variadic
    template would take up way too much code space.<br>
    A varargs constexpr function does not seem legal.<br>

    <br>
    <hr "="">Abandoned concepts:<br>
    <br>
    To get the linker to supply JMP target addresses we can implement
    program chunks via an array of init'ed objects.<br>
    Targets are the public name of an array of init statements.<br>
    Each such chunk of inits is given an attribute of being in the
    program segment defined for each GPIO program bank.<br>
    <br>
    The linker will be told to build these in a memory that is not
    implemented and is designated "noload" so that offsets are
    calculated like for rom that inits ram but nothing is loaded into
    the init stuff.<br>
    IE we build an actual rom segment but the addresses are set to start
    at 0 in some segment that is not loaded by the elf file parser
    itself.<br>
    <br>
    initialized data, goes into rom but with addresses as if in ram:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In MEMORY command :<br>
    <br>
    One each of the following for each PIO present.<br>
    PIOSPACE (wx) : ORIGIN = 0, LENGTH = 32<br>
    <br>
    In SECTION :<br>
    <br>
    .piocode: {<br>
    &nbsp; *(.rpiocode)<br>
    } &gt;PIOSPACE AT&gt;FLASH<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In your program<br>
    <br>
    __attribute((segment=.piocode)) <br>
    PioThingy myroutine[]={<br>
    &nbsp;{MOV, X, Y },<br>
    &nbsp;{JMP, otherroutine }<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    __attribute((segment=.piocode)) <br>
    PioThingy otheroutine[]={<br>
    &nbsp;{more code}<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    So we need macros:<br>
    <br>
    #define Program( name)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    __attribute((segment=.piocode))&nbsp; PioThingy name []={<br>
    #define Label( name)&nbsp;&nbsp; };&nbsp;
    __attribute((segment=.piocode))&nbsp; PioThingy name []={<br>
    #define EndProgram&nbsp;&nbsp; };<br>
    <br>
    It would be handy if we can make an array of ints init by constexpr
    functions.<br>
