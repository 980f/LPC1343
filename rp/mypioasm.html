    <h3>RP2040 <br>
      PIO programming library</h3>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <h3>What is it good for?</h3>
    <p>The goal of this development is to be able to create C++ objects
      which generate the binary to put into the PIO state machine
      configuration and instruction memories.<br>
      This is to not have to use a make program to run the vendor's pio
      assembler tools to create C++ source files.<br>
      It is also an avenue to dynamically modifying pio programs as the
      application discovers useful things.</p>
    <p>Construction of a program object will record options needed for
      configuration, such as sideset number of bits. <br>
      The program object will have an array of instruction objects which
      are at runtime used to create the instruction memory contents.<br>
      There is a chance that templates will be able to do the
      'compilation', we shall see. The difficulty there is forward
      referenced jump targets.</p>
    <p>One approach would be to have an indefinite sized array of
      assembler directive objects. Iteration over them would generate
      the assembled binary.<br>
      Such objects would sometimes just update the configuration image.</p>
    <p>A big caveat is that you cannot reliably use structs with bit
      fields for the actual configuration registers as the C++ compiler
      cannot be told that all must be accessed as 32 bit objects. This
      is a common problem with cortex parts, peripheral registers that
      must be accessed as specific widths that might be wider than the
      compiler thinks it can get by with.</p>
    <p>The non optimized approach is to use such structs but in regular
      memory, then copy as a block into the peripherals. In the case of
      an application downloading different programs at different times
      that is actually an optimal approach.</p>

    To get the linker to supply JMP target addresses we can implement
    program chunks via an array of init'ed objects.<br>
    Targets are the public name of an array of init statements.<br>
    Each such chunk of inits is given an attribute of being in the
    program segment defined for each GPIO program bank.<br>
    <br>
    The linker will be told to build these in a memory that is not
    implemented and is designated "noload" so that offsets are
    calculated like for rom that inits ram but nothing is loaded into
    the init stuff.<br>
    IE we build an actual rom segment but the addresses are set to start
    at 0 in some segment that is not loaded by the elf file parser
    itself.<br>
    <br>
    initialized data, goes into rom but with addresses as if in ram:<br>
    <br>
    /* data with non-zero initializers */<br>
    &nbsp; .data :{<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . = ALIGN(4); /* alignment padding for
    startupCopy disappeared spontaneously, causing an elf file load
    error- shifting bytes to boundary.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    apparently we have been lucky for years that the segments naturally
    aligned. */<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(SORT(.data.*))<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(.data)<br>
    &nbsp; } &gt;SRAM AT&gt;FLASH<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In MEMORY command :<br>
    <br>
    PIOSPACE (wx) : ORIGIN = 0, LENGTH = 32<br>
    <br>
    In SECTION :<br>
    <br>
    .piocode: {<br>
    &nbsp; *(.rpiocode)<br>
    } &gt;PIOSPACE AT&gt;FLASH<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In your program<br>
    <br>
    __attribute((segment=.piocode)) <br>
    PioThingy myroutine[]={<br>
    &nbsp;{MOV, X, Y },<br>
    &nbsp;{JMP, otherroutine }<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    __attribute((segment=.piocode)) <br>
    PioThingy otheroutine[]={<br>
    &nbsp;{more code}<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    So we need macros:<br>
    <br>
    #define Program( name)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    __attribute((segment=.piocode))&nbsp; PioThingy name []={<br>
    #define Label( name)&nbsp;&nbsp; };&nbsp;
    __attribute((segment=.piocode))&nbsp; PioThingy name []={<br>
    #define EndProgram&nbsp;&nbsp; };<br>
    <br>
    It would be handy if we can make an array of ints init by constexpr
    functions.<br>

    <h3>Linking Loader</h3>
    A run time linking loader is simpler than manipulating linker
    segments, and is almost free since we need to actively load the
    program regardless of how the image is formed.<br>
    <br>
    A program line object can hold attributes as well as the content.<br>
    Each program line is a constructor call, saving off fields that will
    generate the bit pattern later.<br>
    One of the fields can be a const char&nbsp; * which has the size of
    a pointer locally and of the string in the ro section.<br>
    The loader will scan the program and for each JMP can do a linear
    scan of the whole program which is at most 32 items.<br>
    If we can force the linker to share string constants that would be
    nice, if not we do strcmp.<br>
    Other attributes will be booleans like "load loop register with this
    item's address". <br>
    While this doesn't allow a compile time determination of double use,
    neither does anyone else's tool as far as I know.<br>
    <br>
    PioLines can be either instructions or labels, a union of const char
    * and PioInstruction, and PioControl.<br>
    PioInstruction factories will be constexpr and will call constexpr
    constructors of each instruction format.<br>
    PioControls are things like execctrl options such as output field
    origin, input field origin, testbit, sideset/delay selector.<br>
    If those PioControls are not all set by a single constexpr call we
    can't use them to create compilations errors when generating
    PioInstructions.<br>
    <br>
    If we don't recognize a faulty program until we go to load it then
    the application must have some mechanism for reporting that to
    users, and that mechanism should be const constructor callable. <br>
    wtf() needs to add a maxTracker that can be interrogated and
    cleared, and perhaps a "last 8 errors mru with counts" optional
    feature.<br>
    So we will need a constable ProgramContext that can be constexpr
    constructed and referenced by PioLine generators. A variadic
    template would take up way too much code space.<br>
    A varargs constexpr function does not seem legal.<br>
    <br>
    class PioLine {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uint16_t basePattern;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uint8_t ticks;//will idiot check on load<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uint8_t sideset;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool looper; //reference will get lookedup and
    set into .wrap, this line into .wraptarget<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const char* label;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const char* reference;//jump target, loop target
    which will go to a register not the code memory<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const char* loopto; //but only one notnull or
    equal to others will make sense<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static constexpr PioLine MOV(SourceEnum src,
    DestEnum dest){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //code to build an object<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static constexpr PioLine JMP(CC cc, const
    char*target){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PioLine &amp; L(const char *label){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this-&gt;label=label;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return *this;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PioLine &amp; delay(unsigned ticks){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this-&gt;ticks=ticks;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return *this;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PioLine &amp; side(unsigned bits){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sideset=bits;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return *this;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PioLine &amp; loop(const char *target){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    <br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    class PioProgam {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //values for registers<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //pointer to array of PioLine<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; void load(const PioLine *program,unsigned length){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for each line<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switch(type){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case JMP: {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for whole
    of program space search for a label that matches the reference<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //first check pointer equality, in case compiler
    and linker conspire to fold constants<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(matches){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pattern insertfield
    (targetfield, index of item that matched)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
