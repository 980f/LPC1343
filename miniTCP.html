    Mini TCP implementation <br>
    <br>
    Skipped packet: <br>
    If incoming seq!=expected (recorded in lastAckSent) then send a dupack with last seq acked as request for retransmission. <br>
    <br>
    optional timeout retransmission: <br>
    base timeout is: RTT average+max(G,4*RTT variance) G clock granularity(round up)<br>
    RTT: round trip time from recent comms. <br>
    double with each retry <br>
    Our implementation: user provides a constant.<br>
    <br>
    To control remote sender:<br>
    receive window == receive space available <br>
    send a 0 when there is no room. The remote sender will then occasionally send something small to try to restart comms. <br>
    <br>
    Our implementation: double buffered, return either size of buffer or zero depending upon whether 'other' buffer has been released.<br>
    <br>
    MSS is maximum that can be received ever, separate numbers for each end. <br>
    Our implementation disallows window scaling, we never support more than 64k windows, typically much smaller.<br>
    <br>
    PSH bit is targeted at the local sending stack, but may also be of interest at the receiver. <br>
    We make it available with data as indication of "end of frame".<br>
    <br>
    Outgoing sequence nominal starts with a random number, but is thereafter a count.<br>
    Ditto for received sequence. <br>
    We start with 0, or user provided start value with connect call.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Seq and ack are 32 bits, wraps at 4Gb sent.<br>
    Ack returns incoming SEQ+length, aka next expected sequence. For SYN response pretend the length is 1.<br>
    SEQ of pure ACK <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    outgoing ACK= expected value of next incoming SEQ<br>
    outgoing SEQ=count of own sendings, SYN = 1<br>
    ACK bit means "I am sending an ACK value"<br>

    TCP protocol operations may be divided into three phases. <i>Connection establishment</i> is a multi-step handshake process that establishes a connection before entering the <i>data transfer</i> phase. After data transmission is completed, the <i>connection termination</i> closes the connection and releases all allocated resources. <br>
    A TCP connection is managed by an operating system through a resource that represents the local end-point for communications, the <i><a

    <br>
    To establish a connection, TCP uses a three-way <a href="/wiki/Handshaking"
      title="Handshaking">handshake</a>. Before a client attempts to connect with a server, the server must first bind to and listen at a port to open it up for connections: this is called a passive open. Once the passive open is established, a client may initiate an active open. To establish a connection, the three-way (or 3-step) handshake occurs:
    <ol>
      <li><b>SYN</b>: The active open is performed by the client sending a SYN to the server. The client sets the segment's sequence number to a random value A.</li>
      <li><b>SYN-ACK</b>: In response, the server replies with a SYN-ACK. The acknowledgment number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. A+1, and the sequence number that the server chooses for the packet is another random number, B.</li>
      <li><b>ACK</b>: Finally, the client sends an ACK back to the server. The sequence number is set to the received acknowledgement value i.e. A+1, and the acknowledgement number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. B+1.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    At this point, both the client and server have received an acknowledgment of the connection. The steps 1, 2 establish the connection parameter (sequence number) for one direction and it is acknowledged. The steps 2, 3 establish the connection parameter (sequence number) for the other direction and it is acknowledged. With these, a full-duplex communication is established.

    The connection termination phase uses a four-way handshake, with each side of the connection terminating independently. When an endpoint wishes to stop its half of the connection, it transmits a FIN packet, which the other end acknowledges with an ACK. Therefore, a typical tear-down requires a pair of FIN and ACK segments from each TCP endpoint. After the side that sent the first FIN has responded with the final ACK, it waits for a timeout before finally closing the connection, during which time the local port is unavailable for new connections; this prevents confusion due to delayed packets being delivered during subsequent connections. <br>
    A connection can be <a href="/wiki/TCP_half-open" title="TCP half-open">"half-open"</a>, in which case one side has terminated its end, but the other has not. The side that has terminated can no longer send any data into the connection, but the other side can. The terminating side should continue reading the data until the other side terminates as well. <br>
    It is also possible to terminate the connection by a 3-way handshake, when host A sends a FIN and host B replies with a FIN &amp; ACK (merely combines 2 steps into one) and host A replies with an ACK.<sup
      id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[17]</a></sup> <br>
    Some operating systems, such as <a href="/wiki/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a> and <a
      href="/w/index.php?title=H-UX&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new"
      title="H-UX (page does not exist)">H-UX</a>, implement a half-duplex close sequence in the TCP stack. If the host actively closes a connection, while still having unread incoming data available, the host sends the signal RST (losing any received data) instead of FIN.<sup
      id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[18]</a></sup> This assures a TCP application that the remote process has read all the transmitted data by waiting for the signal FIN, before it actively closes the connection. The remote process cannot distinguish between an RST signal for <i>connection aborting</i> and <i>data loss</i>. Both cause the remote stack to lose all data received. <br>
    Some application protocols using the TCP open/close handshaking for the application protocol open/close handshaking may find the RST problem on active close. As an example:
    <pre>s = connect(remote);
send(s, data);
close(s);
</pre> <br>
    For a program flow like above, a TCP/IP stack like that described above does not guarantee that all the data arrives to the other application if unread data has arrived at this end.
    <h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reliable_transmission">Reliable transmission</span> </h4>
    <br>
    TCP uses a <i>sequence number</i> to identify each byte of data. The sequence number identifies the order of the bytes sent from each computer so that the data can be reconstructed in order, regardless of any <a
      href="/wiki/Packet_reordering" class="mw-redirect" title="Packet reordering">packet reordering</a>, or <a
      href="/wiki/Packet_loss" title="Packet loss">packet loss</a> that may occur during transmission. The sequence number of the first byte is chosen by the transmitter for the first packet, which is flagged SYN. This number can be arbitrary, and should, in fact, be unpredictable to defend against <a
      href="/wiki/TCP_sequence_prediction_attack" title="TCP sequence prediction attack">TCP sequence prediction attacks</a>. <br>
    Acknowledgements (ACKs) are sent with a sequence number by the receiver of data to tell the sender that data has been received to the specified byte. ACKs do not imply that the data has been delivered to the application. They merely signify that it is now the receiver's responsibility to deliver the data. <br>
    Reliability is achieved by the sender detecting lost data and retransmitting it. TCP uses two primary techniques to identify loss. Retransmission timeout (abbreviated as RTO) and duplicate cumulative acknowledgements (DupAcks).
    <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Dupack-based_retransmission">Dupack-based retransmission</span><span
        class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a
          href="/w/index.php?title=Transmission_Control_Protocol&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10"
          title="Edit section: Dupack-based retransmission">edit</a><span
          class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h5>
    <br>
    If a single segment (say segment 100) in a stream is lost, then the receiver cannot acknowledge packets above no. 100 because it uses cumulative ACKs. Hence the receiver acknowledges packet 99 again on the receipt of another data packet. This duplicate acknowledgement is used as a signal for packet loss. That is, if the sender receives three duplicate acknowledgements, it retransmits the last unacknowledged packet. A threshold of three is used because the network may reorder segments causing duplicate acknowledgements. This threshold has been demonstrated to avoid spurious retransmissions due to reordering.<sup
      id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[20]</a></sup> Sometimes <a
      href="/wiki/Selective_acknowledgement" class="mw-redirect" title="Selective acknowledgement">selective acknowledgements</a> (SACKs) are used to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP's ability to retransmit the right segments.
    <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Timeout-based_retransmission">Timeout-based retransmission</span><span
        class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a

          class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h5>
    <br>
    When a sender transmits a segment, it initializes a timer with a conservative estimate of the arrival time of the acknowledgement. The segment is retransmitted if the timer expires, with a new timeout threshold of twice the previous value, resulting in exponential backoff behavior. Typically, the initial timer value is RTT average+max(G,4*RTT variance) <span
