      PIO programming library</p>
    <p><br>
      The goal of this development is to be able to create C++ objects which generate the binary to put into the PIO state machine configuration and instruction memories.<br>
      This is to not have to use a make program to run the vendor's pio assembler tools to create C++ source files.<br>
      It is also an avenue to dynamically modifying pio programs as the application discovers useful things.</p>
    <p>Construction of a program object will record options needed for configuration, such as sideset number of bits. <br>
      The program object will have an array of instruction objects which are at runtime used to create the instruction memory contents.<br>
      There is a chance that templates will be able to do the 'compilation', we shall see. The difficulty there is forward referenced jump targets.</p>
    <p>One approach would be to have an indefinite sized array of assembler directive objects. Iteration over them would generate the assembled binary.<br>
      Such objects would sometimes just update the configuration image.</p>
    <p>A big caveat is that you cannot reliably use structs with bit fields for the actual configuration registers as the C++ compiler cannot be told that all must be accessed as 32 bit objects. This is a common problem with cortex parts, peripheral registers that must be accessed as specific widths that might be wider than the compiler thinks it can get by with.</p>
    <p>The non optimized approach is to use such structs but in regular memory, then copy as a block into the peripherals. In the case of an application downloading different programs at different times that is actually an optimal approach.</p>

    To get the linker to supply JMP target addresses we can implement program chunks via an array of init'ed objects.<br>
    Targets are the public name of an array of init statements.<br>
    Each such chunk of inits is given an attribute of being in the program segment defined for each GPIO program bank.<br>
    <br>
    The linker will be told to build these in a memory that is not implemented and is designated "noload" so that offsets are calculated like for rom that inits ram but nothing is loaded into the init stuff.<br>
    IE we build an actual rom segment but the addresses are set to start at 0 in some segment that is not loaded by the elf file parser itself.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    initialized data, goes into rom but with addresses as if in ram:<br>
    <br>
    /* data with non-zero initializers */<br>
    &nbsp; .data :{<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . = ALIGN(4); /* alignment padding for startupCopy disappeared spontaneously, causing an elf file load error- shifting bytes to boundary.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apparently we have been lucky for years that the segments naturally aligned. */<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(SORT(.data.*))<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(.data)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* *(.gnu.linkonce.d.*) /* these should not get produced. If they do expose this and fix its syntax errors, and documented what generated them */<br>
    &nbsp; } &gt;SRAM AT&gt;FLASH<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; .startupCopy : { /* this initializes an instance of what cstartup.cpp calls 'struct RamInitBlock' */<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LONG(LOADADDR(.data))<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LONG(ADDR(.data))<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LONG((SIZEOF(.data)+3)&gt;&gt;2)<br>
    &nbsp; } &gt;FLASH<br>
    &nbsp; __data_segment__ = LOADADDR(.startupCopy);<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In MEMORY command :<br>
    <br>
    PIOSPACE (wx) : ORIGIN = 0, LENGTH = 32<br>
    <br>
    In SECTION :<br>
    <br>
    .piocode: {<br>
    &nbsp; *(.rpiocode)<br>
    } &gt;PIOSPACE AT&gt;FLASH<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In your program<br>
    <br>
    __attribute((segment=.piocode)) <br>
    PioThingy myroutine[]={<br>
    &nbsp;{MOV, X, Y },<br>
    &nbsp;{JMP, otherroutine }<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    __attribute((segment=.piocode)) <br>
    PioThingy otheroutine[]={<br>
    &nbsp;{more code}<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    So we need macros:<br>
    <br>
    #define Program( name)&nbsp;&nbsp; __attribute((segment=.piocode))&nbsp; PioThingy name []={<br>
    #define Label( name)&nbsp;&nbsp; };&nbsp; __attribute((segment=.piocode))&nbsp; PioThingy name []={<br>
    #define EndProgram&nbsp;&nbsp; };<br>
    <br>
    It would be handy if we can make an array of ints init by constexpr functions.<br>
